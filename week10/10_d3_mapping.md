# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Mapping and Time Sliders

This week, we are running through the basics of mapping with D3! Our exercise this week is going to involve creating a map, adding data, and then interaction using a time slider. We will then show a number of examples, and introduce the concepts of working with projections, TopoJSON, choropleths, and tabular data.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you will want to do is grab a current copy of the repo from Github. In here, you will find data and code examples for the exercises, and some supplemental files for your reference.

2. Start up a localhost python server in the directory named *d3-examples*. This folder contains code examples and data folder. This is where we will do our map design and coding.

3. Find the in-class exercise at:

[http://duspviz.mit.edu/d3-workshop/mapping-data-with-d3/](http://duspviz.mit.edu/d3-workshop/mapping-data-with-d3/)

This page will contain the tutorial for the week. We are going to make a map using JavaScript and D3 methods!

4. The take-home problem set (10_PSET7_sliderMap) is found at the following in this weeks folder.
