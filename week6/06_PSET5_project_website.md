# Front End Environments
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set 5

### Instructions

We are giving you more time for this Problem Set, because next week is your midterm presentation and you should focus on that first. Once midterms are set and you have your topic, we want you to create a website for your project.

For this Problem Set:

#### Part 1 - Create a Project Website

Create a project homepage on your Github site that you will use to host your project and data visualizations. It is up to you how to structure it. One team member can set up a website in their account for the team and invite others can commit and collaborate.

You should put your midterm presentation on your website as a showcase of what your project will be and do.

Also, develop a base level branding (project name, logo, font, and color scheme) for your team and project. Customize your website by changing fonts, colors, and images that go with your project. 

On your website:

1. Include your branding in your design
2. Name of your project team and a short summary of your project
3. Include your mid-term presentation

You just need one website per project group.

##### Some suggestions

Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) or [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) in your page customization. If you use Bootstrap, there tutorial at this link shows you [how to get started with customizing Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/). You can find free Bootstrap tempates at [http://startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Use a template like a [Bootstrap Carousel](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp) to show your slides.

#### Part 2 - Begin to Explore and Visualize your Project Data

You must identify and explore the data you intend to use for your project and have it in hand. You should:

1. Please be prepared to present the teaching team with your revised scope of work based on feedback you recieved today.
2. Identify the data you want to use for the project. Obtain that data either through our Dropbox folder, Amazon server, or scraping yourself. (A sample would be fine, but we would prefer the whole data set.)
3. Create at least one chart and one map that shows off your datasets.

#### Part 3 - Get Started with D3

Get started with D3 by grabbing an example of your choice from [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/-/about). One of the best ways to get started is to read and implement some of the code available online. Mike Bostock, the creator of D3, has implemented a website called [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/) that is designed to display code and showcase examples of D3 code saved on Github. Find a ton of examples on the [main blocks page](https://bl.ocks.org/), and Mike Bostock has a bunch of examples himself located on [his Bl.ocks page](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock).

For Part 3 of the Problem Set, your project team should get a D3 visualization from blocks, copy the respective code into files on your server, and get it running on your website. It can be on a separate page. You don't need to incorporate your own data at this point.

1. Get the code for visualization you like and might be similar to what you want to use from [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/).
2. Set it up on a page on your website.
