# Big Data, Visualization, and Society
## Midterm Presentation Instructions

### Midterm Requirements

You and your project group should prepare a presentation of what you intend to do for your final project. Your presentations should be a maximum of 10 minutes. We will then have 10-15 minutes to review.

Presentations should consist of the following:

1. Topic you seek to explore using data, why you think it is important. Provide the audience with the context.
2. Present your visualization as a mock-up. It can be a series of Illustrator files, and does not have to work, but clearly show us what you plan to develop. This will be your wire frame for moving forward in the class and it will be your guide for your programming development.
3. Say what data you plan to use to make your visualization and how you will obtain it.
4. Tell us what tools you hope to use to create your visualization. You should have begun to investigate a few.
5. Create a timeline for the development of your visualization, what will you try to get done when. Super important to develop milestones.
6. Team responsibilities - who will be responsible for what?
