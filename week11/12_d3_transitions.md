# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Transitions and Animations

This week, we are looking at transitions and animations. In other words, transitions are the way you add animation and movement to your map that work with interactions and make your visualizations visually interesting and appealing.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you will want to do is grab a current copy of the repo from Github. Follow the same process as in previous weeks. In here, you will find data and code examples for the exercises.

2. Start up a localhost python server in the directory. This is where we will do our visualization design and coding.

3. Find the in-class exercise at:

This page will contain the tutorial for the week. We are going working through making transitions and animations using javascript and D3 methods!

4. There is no take home problem set this week, you should spend the time working on your projects.

#### Take the knowledge from today and continue to learn D3!
