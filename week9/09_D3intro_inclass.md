# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Learn the Basics, Draw an SVG Bar Chart and a Map

This week, we are going to start digging into D3! Our exercise this week is going to involve creating a bar chart from scratch, illustrating D3 principles on the way.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you will want to do is grab a current copy of the repo from Github. In the repo for the week, you will find data and code examples for the exercises.

2. Start up a *localhost python server* in the directory that contains your examples and data folder. This is where we will do our visualization design and coding.

3. Find the in-class exercise at:

[http://duspviz.mit.edu/d3-workshop/intro-to-d3/](http://duspviz.mit.edu/d3-workshop/intro-to-d3/)

This page will contain the tutorial for the week. We are going to make a bar chart using javascript and D3 methods!

4. The take-home problem set (PSET6_d3_introduction) is found at the following in this weeks folder.
