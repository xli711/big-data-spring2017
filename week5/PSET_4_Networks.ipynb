    "In this problem set we are going to be working with social data to visualize a network of activism groups. The data is provided by the DUSP CoLab Mapping Resistance project, and contains 41 grassroots social activism and civic justice groups in Pennsylvania. The dataset we provide contains the number of Twitter followers for each of the groups, along with a list of ids of each follower. Our goal is to get a better picture of the social connectivity of these groups, and figure out which of the groups share Twitter followers, and of the ones that share followers, how many are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was scraped from Twitter using the REST API, not too unlike what we did last week. It is provided to you in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format in the **jsons** folder in your materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give you the functions we used to aggregate and create the network datasets, your job is to build the network using NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will read in the data. While **NetworkX** has a number of built-in functions to import data, and directly construct a network, our data doesn't follow their requirements. We will select it through **pandas**, and then we will build the network procedurally using Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we take look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the list of social justice groups\n",
    "2. Create nodes\n",
    "3. Create edges\n",
    "4. Construct the NetworkX drawing"

From this, we can work towards building a network. To start, let's load our spreadsheet of organizations and create a list of the twitter names so we can build a function that will automatically load the JSONS. There is a CSV named `social_justice_orgs_pa.csv` that contains the names of each of the organizations, their twitter handles, and a bunch of other information.\n",
