    "### 0. Networks Overview\n",
    "Real-world data can be represented through graphs. At the same time, analytical models have been developed to simulate and compare models with real-world networks, allowing us to abstract, simulate and identify specific conditions of the network in a controlled model. The understanding of the components and properties of the representation provides a useful roadmap for their use in developing their appropriate spatial representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, **graphs** are used to represent **networks**. A graph represents entities that can be connected with each other through pair-like links or **edges**. The objects represented in a graph are called **nodes**, and they represent the fundamental unit of graphs . **Nodes** can have a number of properties and are indivisible. The relationships between the nodes of a graph are specified by **edges**, or connections among nodes. In more complex graph representations, edges or relationships can be **directed** or **undirected**, where the relationship is symmetric or asymmetric. Similarly edges can be **weighted** according to discrete relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "![IPython](images/Graph_theory_tree.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the nodes are represented by numbered circles, and the edges are the undirected lines connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Properties\n",
    "The organization of a network can be described based on its topology, or arrangement of nodes and edges. At the same time, a number of network properties that analyze the topological conditions of the network can be described. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network **Degree** is the number of edges that are incident on a node. Nodes with a higher degree are more connected to other nodes, and can become network hubs. Network **Paths** are a sequence of nodes in which each node is adjacent to the next one. The shortest path between two nodes is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them. Finally, the **Clustering Coefficient** is a description of the connectedness of the neighbors of a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships Among Networks\n",
    "When describing networks through graph relationships it is possible to construct models of isolated networks, or models that can represent relationships among different sets or spatial layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mono-partite Networks** are the simplest network representation. All the nodes of mono-partite networks are part of the same set of information. **Road networks** can be an example of mono-partite networks, where each node is road starting point or intersection with other road. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutli-partite Networks** are networks whose nodes can be divided into multiple independent sets or sublayers of information. In this representation, nodes from different networks can be  related to each other, constructing heterogeneous relationships among its nodes. For example, if we represent a social network we could map both the relationships between users, and the social posts each user has, combining two distinct sets of nodes. \n"

    "[**NetworkX**](https://networkx.github.io/) is a Python library for representing graphs and networks. It contains `classes` for creating `graphs` and `digraphs`, and functions to calculate network properties such as `adjacency, degree, diameter, radius, center, betweenness`, etc. Additionally, it contains functionality for drawing **2D** and **3D** networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to import the libraries, and some of their components. **NetworkX**, Networkx contains many algorithms for common network computations. NetworkX wraps the mathematical components of a graph into a `dictionary` like syntax, exposing **nodes** and **edges** as `dictionaries`. Dictionaries allow the inclusion of metadata along with the network topology within the network structure. To install **NetworkX** on a terminal or the command line, run the following command:\n",
